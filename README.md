# Hi, I'm Karen Liu (she/her) ðŸ’œ
Hey, I'm Karen, a Mechatronics Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo who loves design and tackling complex problems. I aim use technology to help people live happier and simpler lives.

With a focus on exploration and growth, I'm ambitious and embrace feedback, actively applying it to evolve and improve.

In my pastime I enjoy all kinds of things! whether it's enjoying a matcha, cozying up with my cat Harry, or exploring the city, Iâ€™m open to new experiences :)
